/**
 * CameraPreview — live, self-view (mirrored) camera feed for GO1.
 *
 * Pure consumer of the stream owned by useMediaStream: it attaches the stream
 * to a <video> for display only and never stops tracks.
 *
 * iOS Safari notes:
 *   - `playsInline` is required or Safari forces fullscreen playback.
 *   - `muted` is required for autoplay (and prevents echo from the live mic).
 *   - `srcObject` must be set imperatively — React can't set it via a prop.
 *   - play() must be called explicitly after setting srcObject.
 *
 * `onVideoNode` (optional) reports the <video> DOM node to a parent so it can run
 * GO1 checks against the same element (e.g. real-time monitoring on /session). A
 * callback ref — not forwardRef — because the parent needs the node as reactive
 * state to drive its check hooks. Memoize it in the parent or the ref will thrash.
